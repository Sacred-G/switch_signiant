    example: Example Jet Job
    
    The job name.
    activeAlerts	JetSearchJobAlerts[
    
    An array containing one or more alerts that are currently applicable to the attached job. At the time of this writing it is not possible to have more than one alert of the same type and some alerts may be mutually exclusive (e.g. a monitor can not be both pending and in error).

    details	{
    description:	
    
    The various properties relevant to alert in question. Important: It may be necessary for callers to make follow-up requests to fetch all the necessary information for a human friendly display. For example it may be necessary to search for the endpoint name using endpointId.

    example: OrderedMap { "endpointId": "296c4c6c-e2a3-4080-833a-aa20ed88db93" }
    }]
    status	string
    example: IN_PROGRESS
    
    The status of the job:
    
        READY: The job waiting for a trigger to initiate a transfer.

    Enum:
    [ RETRYING_TRANSFER, CANNOT_MONITOR_FOLDER, SOURCE_ENDPOINT_OFFLINE, DESTINATION_ENDPOINT_OFFLINE ]
    filesRemaining	number
    example: 5
